          About the project
        </h2>
        <p>The project stems from the necessity of visualizing the data related to young individuals choosing to leave the country of Italy. The aim is to identify possible correlations between the emigration rate and other factors such as the employment rate after graduation, the average of housing prices over the years and the satisfaction with one's working conditions.<br>Inspiration was taken by a report published on the <a href="https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/italy-is-stuck-in-a-european-brain-drain/">European Data Journalism Network</a> by Giuseppe Chiellino (Il Sole 24 Ore) having title "Italy is stuck in a European brain drain". The report highlights the lack of third-level education, especially in the South of Italy, as well as the high emigration rate in the whole country. "Cervelli in Fuga"'s aim is to make an hypothesis on the hidden reasons behind the decision to leave that a lot of Italians make.</p>

                  <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It
                  is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                  appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                  classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing
                  and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
                  with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also
                  worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                  <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit
                  overflow.

This may involve assessing the direct costs of data collection, production, and dissemination, as well as indirect costs such as preservation and rights clearance. The Italian legal framework for the re-use of public sector information (PSI) is governed by several laws and regulations. The main law for cost-free access to PSI is Act no. 241 of 7 August 1990, which provides for general access to government documents, although access in many cases depends on the existence of a legal interest.</td>
