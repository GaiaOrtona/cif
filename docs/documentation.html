                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>"Cervelli in Fuga" is a project on young Italian people and their choice of leaving their home country. Often discussed in the media, the problem of emigration in Italy has various factors that need to be taken into account in order to understand what really lies behind the big number of young people choosing to live and work abroad.</p>

                <div id="item-1-1">
                  <h5>Scenario</h5>
                  <p>This project aims to investigate what might be the possible reasons behind many young people's choice of leaving Italy. Our hypothesis is that the difficulty in gaining a proper economic indipendence and the lack of meritocracy are the main aspects that bring young Italians to leave their home country. In order to consider this hypothesis on the level of data, we have considered 16 datasets related to graduate rate employment, house prices, hourly wage and work satisfaction. The time span taken into account for this analysis goes from 2014 to 2022, as our aim is to give a full picture of young Italians' working conditions in the most recent years. Of course, this project does not aim to draw any conclusions on the matter: in fact, data is not enough to tell the full story and the fact that these aspects might or might not be correlated does not imply that anything in terms of causality. Moreover, the team of this project selected the datasets on the basis of the hypothesis previously stated: therefore, the choice of the datasets is not scientifically grounded. Tithin the sphere of interest, datasets were selected on the basis of availability and compatibility with one another. All these factors considered, it is once again necessary to state that this project is the elaboration of an hypothesis and does not aim to make any type of statements. Further research is needed in order to assess a conclusion, and more datasets need to be taken into account to cross-check the results.</p>

                  <h6>Sources of the original datasets:</h6>
                  <ul>
                  

<li><b>ISTAT </b>is the primary source of statistics in Italy, regarding population, wages, environmental issues, social problems, all gathered through surveys and analyses. Here, focusing on young people and the reason why they emigrate, we decided to analyze quite a number of datasets coming from this source, exploring hourly wages, price of houses, percentage of young people still living with their parents, work satisfaction and percentage of young italians that have emigrated. </li>
<li><b>ALMALAUREA</b> is a consortium joined by 75 Italian universities and the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research, with the purpose or objectives of statistical studies related to the Italian university world. This source has been used to extract information about the rate of employed graduates in Italy. </li>
